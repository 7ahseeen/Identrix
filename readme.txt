Key Features:

    Multi-sequence analysis: Compare DNA, RNA, or protein sequences in FASTA format

    Alignment visualization: View pairwise alignments with scoring

    Similarity groups: Define custom amino acid similarity groups for protein analysis

    Comprehensive metrics: Calculate identity percentages, similarity scores, and alignment statistics

    User-friendly interface: Simple workflow with clear input/output sections

    File operations: Upload FASTA files or save analysis results

Technical Specifications:

    Built with Python 3.13.3

    Utilizes Biopython for sequence alignment algorithms

    BLOSUM62 matrix for protein alignment

    Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
